# MeRo - The Meter Reading Robot

The goal of this project is to create an Android app for periodic meter reading. Most of us have non-smart meters and old smart phones that they do not use any more. With this app, it should be possible to fix an old phone before a non-smart meter and let it periodically take photos, analyze them and send the resulting meter readings to a service.

Contributions are welcome.
